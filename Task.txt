Task 1.4 Collection Framework
Assignment:

Write a char-counter application  that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string.

It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may be passed several times to the method.

Since the counting operation can be time-consuming, the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously encountered, it should return the result from the cache.

Use collections and maps where appropriate.
